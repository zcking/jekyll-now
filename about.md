So you wanna know a little bit about me? Okay, but be warned, I'm not _that_ interesting.

I graduated with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University
of Arkansas at Little Rock. I am a software engineer at First Orion in downtown
Little Rock. I love spending time with my girlfriend, Cherokey, and our labradoodle
puppers, Leo. I'm always
working on side software projects of my own. I play guitar and enjoy experimenting
and creating my own riffs and songs. I really love to cook and like to learn
new foods and styles--authentic cuisine FTW!
