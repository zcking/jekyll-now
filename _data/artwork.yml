  description: If you look closely, you'll notice something interesting about this
    photo--there is an airplane on a helipad. This piece is what I did for a class
    assignment to place a 3D model in an image and make it "fit in." I chose a 3D model
    of an airplane, used Photoshop to place it, recolored, adjusted levels, added
    shadows for realism, and added a lens flare for fun.
