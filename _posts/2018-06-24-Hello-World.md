Welcome to my new blog! Today I launched my new blog, which you see before you.
The reason for the migration is to save money on domain hosting and using a CMS.


This *new* blog is--as you may have figured out--built with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and is hosted with GitHub Pages.


I'll try to keep this site focused on blogging; however, in the coming weeks
there will be additional content being migrated over from my previous website.
This additional content will likely include:  
* Digital artwork of mine
* Games I've written
* Other programming projects


In the past I've struggled with regular blogging, but I intent to change that
in the coming months. I usually have several things I'd love to write about and
share, but finding time proves more difficult. Starting this July, I will
strive to share new updates at least every two weeks.


I look forward to using this fresh outlet to share technical experience,
skills, my life events, and just have a good time.

Au revoir,  
-Z
